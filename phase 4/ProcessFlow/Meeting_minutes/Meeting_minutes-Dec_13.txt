Meeting Discussion:

What Went Well:

The team demonstrated effective collaboration, particularly in resolving blockers.
Agile practices such as sprint planning and retrospectives have been used effectively to guide the process.
The modular design of the code and structured approach to writing test cases ensured efficient code maintenance.

What Could Be Improved:

There was uneven workload distribution, leading to delays in some areas.
The team struggled with over-committing to sprint goals without considering the capacity of each team member.
Some issues arose with untested code being committed, which caused rework during the testing phase.
More detailed edge case testing is needed to ensure robustness in the codebase.

Action Plan for Improvement:

Start:

Documenting lessons learned during the sprint to avoid repeating mistakes in the future.
Start writing comprehensive unit tests that cover edge cases to ensure robust code quality.
Maintain a detailed error log to identify recurring issues during debugging.
Add detailed comments to each section of code to improve readability and help team members understand functionality faster.

Stop:

Stop over-committing to sprint goals without considering the team's capacity.
Stop relying solely on manual testing; automation of test execution will improve efficiency.
Avoid committing untested code and ensure all code passes unit tests before submission.

Continue:

Continue using Agile practices like sprint planning and retrospectives effectively.
Continue optimizing code structure and modular design to maintain efficiency and ease of maintenance.
Continue using a structured approach to write clear and reusable test cases for better maintainability.
Keep using systematic debugging techniques to isolate and resolve issues efficiently.

Next Steps:

Implement the improvements identified in the retrospective for the next sprint.
Address feedback from the sprint review and incorporate it into the upcoming tasks.
