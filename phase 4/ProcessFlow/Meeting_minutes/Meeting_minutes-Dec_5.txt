* Agenda:
Task Tracking System Setup

Task Assignment for Current Sprint

1. Task Tracking System Setup:
A spreadsheet was created to track tasks efficiently.
The following columns were added:
Date Created
Comments (to track updates and progress)
Status (to monitor whether a task is completed, in progress, etc.)
This system will help manage task progress and provide clarity on each taskâ€™s status.

2. Refining Product Backlog:
The product backlog was updated to include more detailed and clear tasks.
Tasks were assigned to individual team members to ensure clarity and ownership.
The sprint goal was reviewed, and the tasks needed to achieve it were prioritized.

3. Task Assignment for Current Sprint:
The main tasks for this sprint were outlined and given an initial status.
Team members were assigned tasks based on their strengths and roles within the project.
It was agreed that some tasks need further refinement and will be rewritten in the correct format for clarity.

* Action Items:
1. Refine Tasks:
Review tasks and refine them further, ensuring they follow the correct format.
2. Update Task Statuses:
Ensure the tracking spreadsheet is updated regularly with task statuses.
3. Next Steps:
Each team member will begin working on the assigned tasks.
We will meet again in the next daily scrum to evaluate the progress and address any blockers.
